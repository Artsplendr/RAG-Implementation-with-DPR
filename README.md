# RAG-Implementation-with-DPR

#### The goal of this experiment is to implement a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) pipeline to answer user queries by combining the strengths of dense passage retrieval for fetching relevant documents and generative models for answering queries.

#### Concept Overview

1. Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR): DPR is a dense retrieval method that retrieves documents based on semantic similarity using learned embeddings.
2. RAG: RAG combines the power of retrieval (e.g., DPR) and generative transformers (e.g., GPT or BART). First, it retrieves relevant passages using a retriever, then generates responses using a language model.

#### Pipeline Workflow
1. Load and preprocess documents for the retrieval database.
2. Create embeddings for documents using a DPR retriever.
3. Use FAISS to index the document embeddings for fast similarity search.
4. Retrieve top-k relevant documents for a user query.
5. Use a generative model to generate an answer based on retrieved documents.

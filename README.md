# RAG-Implementation-with-DPR

#### The goal of this experiment is to implement a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) pipeline to answer user queries by combining the strengths of dense passage retrieval for fetching relevant documents and generative models for answering queries.

#### Concept Overview

1. Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR): DPR is a dense retrieval method that retrieves documents based on semantic similarity using learned embeddings.
2. RAG: RAG combines the power of retrieval (e.g., DPR) and generative transformers. First, it retrieves relevant passages using a retriever, then generates responses using a language model.

#### Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) Architecture

DPR is a neural-based retrieval framework designed to retrieve semantically relevant passages for a given query. DPR uses dense embeddings learned through deep neural networks to match the semantic meaning of queries and documents.

DPR consists of two primary neural networks:
1. Question Encoder: Maps the query into a dense vector (embedding) representation.
2. Context Encoder: Maps each document or passage into a dense vector representation.
These two encoders are trained jointly, so their embeddings are optimized to represent query-document similarity.

#### Pipeline Workflow
1. Load and preprocess documents for the retrieval database.
2. Create embeddings for documents using a DPR retriever.
3. Use FAISS to index the document embeddings for fast similarity search.
4. Retrieve top-k relevant documents for a user query.
5. Use a generative model to generate an answer based on retrieved documents.
